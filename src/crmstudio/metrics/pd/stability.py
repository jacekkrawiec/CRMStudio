Stability metrics for probability of default (PD) models.

This module will provide metrics for assessing the stability of PD models over time,
including Population Stability Index (PSI), Characteristic Stability Index (CSI),
and temporal drift detection methods.

Note: This is a placeholder file for future implementation.
